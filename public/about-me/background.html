                <p>Like many, I graduated college, not sure if I had chosen the right major. I couldn't find a job that
                    paid a decent salary although I had two degrees and many years experience working with children. I
                    began teaching technology and fell in love with what I was teaching. I enjoyed empowering students
                    to create new things and build amazing projects. While participating in the Hour of Code, I began to
                    develop a love for web development and took some time to teach myself front end languages. Due to a
                    lack of job security, I explored careers in technology and realized that there is so much out there
                    to learn. I enrolled in V School's program for career changers. A full-time 12-week full stack
                    development course. There I learned the MEAN stack from highly skilled instructors. This prepared me
                    for competing in a competitive and thriving
                    market of web development.
